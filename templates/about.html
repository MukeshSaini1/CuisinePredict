        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
            The Cuisine Classification Model is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the type of cuisine based on the ingredients used in various dishes. This project involves the following key components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> The dataset used for this project consists of various dishes and their corresponding cuisines. It is represented in a CSV file named <code>cuisines.csv</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Data is cleaned and transformed to create feature vectors for each dish. Ingredients are processed to form the basis for classification.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> A Logistic Regression model is trained on the preprocessed data. The model is evaluated for accuracy and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Application:</strong> A web-based application is built using Flask and Streamlit, allowing users to predict the cuisine based on the ingredients they select.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> For data processing and machine learning model implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Scikit-learn:</strong> For building and evaluating the Logistic Regression model.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandas & Numpy:</strong> For data manipulation and numerical operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> For data visualization.</li>
            <li><strong>SWEETALERT:</strong> For user-friendly alert messages on the web application.</li>
            <li><strong>Flask & Streamlit:</strong> For creating the web interface for the model.</li>
        </ul>
